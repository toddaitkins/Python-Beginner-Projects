# See the Wiki for specific info on individual projects
These are some of the projects I attempted while teaching myself Python.  Feel free to take a look at the work I've done and if you're a Python programmer and have a suggestion on how to improve any of my projects I would love to hear any feedback.

_chessboard.py_ - A simple program using the tkinter module to make a chessboard and move pieces (no error checking)  <br />
_hangman.py_ - A simple command line hangman game with limmited error checking and improper game success tracking (needs work) <br />
_guess_number_game.py_ - A simple command line number guessing game  <br />
_password_generator.py_ - A VERY simple password generator with very little error checking  <br />
_Sine vs Cosine.py_ - A simple program using the numpy module to graph Sine vs Cosine  <br />
