# Python-Beginner-Projects
These are the first projects I attempted while teaching myself Python.  They may not be perfect but they are a good example of what can be accomplished with Python after only a short study of the language.

_Sine vs Cosine.py_ - A simple program using the numpy module to graph Sine vs Cosine  <br />
_guess_number_game.py_ - A simple command line number guessing game
