# Python-Beginner-Projects
These are the first projects I attempted while teaching myself Python.  They may not be perfect but they are a good example of what can be accomplished with Python after only a short study of the language.

*<Sine vs Cosine.py>* - A simple program using the numpy module to graph Sine vs Cosine  <br />
*<guess_number_game.py>* - A simple command line number guessing game
